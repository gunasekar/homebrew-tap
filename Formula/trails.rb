  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      trails diff (prefix G from trails keys) shows a codebase's changes side
      by side with delta when it is installed, and as plain git output
      without it. For side by side:
        brew install git-delta

      To keep the tmux server outside any terminal, so a Force Quit of one
      can't take your agents with it, and bring lost trails back on start:
        brew services start trails
