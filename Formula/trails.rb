    <<~EOS
      trails diff (prefix G from trails keys) shows a codebase's changes side
      by side with delta when it is installed, and as plain git output
      without it. For side by side:
        brew install git-delta
    EOS

    assert_match "usage: trails", shell_output("#{bin}/trails help")
